# SHHQ Dataset

## Overview
SHHQ is a dataset with high-quality full-body human images in a resolution of 1024 × 512.
Since we need to follow a rigorous legal review in our institute, we can not release all of the data at once.

For now, SHHQ-1.0 with 40K images is released! More data will be released in the later versions.
